# Shenko Codebase Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Shenko codebase to make it more robust, maintainable, and efficient.

## 1. Version Management

- Created a single source of truth for the version number in `_version.py`
- Updated both `setup.py` and `menu.py` to import the version from this file
- Fixed the format in `_version.py` to remove redundant text

## 2. Asset Management

- Created a dedicated `assets.py` utility module for proper asset path resolution
- Implemented functions for retrieving paths to different types of assets
- Ensured assets can be loaded regardless of the working directory
- Added fallback mechanisms when assets aren't found in the expected location

## 3. Logging System

- Implemented a proper logging system with timestamps and categorization in `logger.py`
- Added different log levels for varying severity of messages
- Created utility functions for uncaught exception handling
- Added crash logs with detailed traceback information for critical errors

## 4. UI Utilities

- Created a centralized `ui.py` module for consistent UI element creation
- Implemented standardized button creation functions
- Added utility for creating consistent version text displays
- Implemented proper UI cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
- Added tracking of UI elements for easier batch operations

## 5. Improved Fullscreen Functionality

- Enhanced the `toggle_fullscreen` function to detect screen resolution
- Added support for 4K displays
- Implemented proper logging of screen mode changes
- Added graceful fallback when resolution detection fails

## 6. Code Organization

- Added proper docstrings to functions and classes
- Refactored imports for better readability and maintainability
- Removed redundant code and consolidated duplicate functionality
- Improved organization with utility modules for specific functionality

## 7. Updated Dependencies

- Modernized dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Updated version specifications to more secure versions
- Organized requirements into logical categories
- Added comments for clarity on optional dependencies

## 8. Better Error Handling

- Implemented proper exception handling for critical operations
- Added graceful shutdown procedure in the `quit` function
- Ensured resources are properly cleaned up during application exit
- Added logging of errors during the shutdown process

## Architecture Benefits

These improvements provide several benefits to the codebase:

1. **Maintainability**: Code is now more organized and follows better practices
2. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and logging makes issues easier to diagnose
3. **Flexibility**: Asset management works regardless of working directory
4. **Readability**: Consistent code style and proper documentation
5. **Reusability**: Common functionality extracted into utility functions
6. **Security**: Updated dependencies to more secure versions

## Future Recommendations

1. Convert the remaining UI screens to use the new UI utilities
2. Implement a proper resource management system for 3D models
3. Consider restructuring the FSM implementation for better separation of concerns
4. Add proper unit tests for the utility modules
5. Set up continuous integration for automated testing
6. Consider implementing a configuration system for user preferences
